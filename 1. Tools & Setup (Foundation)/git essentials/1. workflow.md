# ⚙️ Git Essentials: Workflow and Basics

This file covers the fundamental concepts and commands necessary to use Git effectively for local version control and remote collaboration.

## 1\. What is Git?

**Git** is a free and open-source **Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)** designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. It tracks changes in source code during software development, allowing multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without interference.

### 🌟 Features of Git

  * **Distributed System:** Every developer has a full copy of the entire repository history, meaning you can work offline and collaboration is robust.
  * **Non-linear Development:** It excels at managing multiple independent lines of development through powerful **branching** capabilities.
  * **Integrity:** The content is protected by **SHA-1 hashing**, ensuring that the project history cannot be tampered with.
  * **Speed:** Operations like committing and branching are extremely fast because they primarily interact with the local repository.

### ❓ Git vs. GitHub

It's common for beginners to confuse these two terms:

| Git | GitHub (or GitLab, Bitbucket) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Tool** (Software installed locally) | **Service** (A website/cloud platform) |
| A **Version Control System** that tracks file changes. | A **Remote Repository Host** that stores your Git projects. |
| You use **CLI commands** (`git add`, `git commit`) locally. | You use a **browser interface** to manage access, issues, and Pull Requests. |
| **Local** storage of your project history. | **Cloud/Remote** storage for collaboration and backup. |

## 2\. Git Terminology

Understanding these terms is crucial before diving into the commands:

  * **Repository (Repo):** The project folder where Git stores all the history and metadata.
  * **Working Directory:** The files you are currently viewing and editing on your local machine.
  * **Staging Area (Index):** A temporary area where you prepare changes before committing them. It acts as a draft for your next commit.
  * **Commit:** A **snapshot** of your repository at a specific point in time. Each commit is identified by a unique **SHA-1 hash**.
  * **Branch:** An independent line of development. The primary branch is usually named `main` or `master`.
  * **HEAD:** A pointer to the latest commit in the current branch.
  * **Remote:** The version of your repository hosted on a service like GitHub.

## 3\. The Core Git Workflow: Staging and Committing

This three-stage process is the heart of Git version control.

| Stage | Action | Command | VS Code UI |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Modify** | You edit files in the **Working Directory**. | *(No command needed)* | Edit files in the Editor. |
| **2. Stage** | Selectively move modified files to the **Staging Area**. | `git add <file-name>` or `git add .` | Click the **`+` (Plus)** icon next to the file in the Source Control panel. |
| **3. Commit** | Save the snapshot from the Staging Area to the **Local Repository** history. | `git commit -m "Your descriptive message"` | Type message, then click **Commit** button. |

## 4\. 12 Essential Git Commands

Here are the most important commands used in the daily Git workflow:

| Command | Category | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`git init`** | **Setup** | Creates a new local Git repository. |
| **`git clone <url>`** | **Setup** | Downloads an existing remote repository to your local machine. |
| **`git status`** | **Inspection** | Shows the state of the working directory and staging area (which files are modified, staged, or untracked). |
| **`git add .`** | **Staging** | Stages all modified and new files for the next commit. |
| **`git commit -m "msg"`** | **Committing** | Records the staged changes as a new commit in the local history. |
| **`git log`** | **Inspection** | Shows the commit history. |
| **`git diff`** | **Inspection** | Shows the difference between the working directory and the staging area, or between two commits. |
| **`git branch <name>`** | **Branching** | Creates a new branch. |
| **`git checkout <name>`** | **Branching** | Switches to another branch (used heavily in older Git versions). |
| **`git switch <name>`** | **Branching** | Modern, safer command for switching branches. |
| **`git merge <name>`** | **Branching** | Integrates changes from the specified branch into the current branch. |
| **`git remote add <name> <url>`** | **Remote** | Connects your local repo to a remote server (e.g., GitHub). |

-----

## 5\. Collaboration and Remote Work

Once you are working on a team or storing notes on GitHub, you need commands to interact with the **Remote**.

| Command | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`git push origin <branch>`** | Uploads your local branch commits to the remote repository. (Used when sharing new work.) |
| **`git pull origin <branch>`** | Fetches and automatically merges changes from the remote repository into your current local branch. (Used before starting work.) |
| **`git fetch origin`** | Downloads changes from the remote but **does not merge** them into your local branch (allows for inspection first). |

-----

## 6\. Undoing and Inspecting Changes

Knowing how to look at the history and fix mistakes is essential.

### Undoing Changes

| Action | Command | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Unstage a file** | `git reset HEAD <file-name>` | Moves a staged file back to the working directory (before commit). |
| **Discard local changes** | `git checkout -- <file-name>` | Discards *un-staged* changes in the working directory (returns the file to its last committed state). **Caution: This is destructive.** |
| **Rewrite last commit** | `git commit --amend` | Opens an editor to allow you to change the message or add missing files to the *most recent* commit. |

### Inspecting Changes

| Command | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`git log`** | Lists the entire commit history for the current branch. |
| **`git log --oneline`** | Shows a condensed, single-line view of the history. |
| **`git diff`** | Shows the difference between your current work and the last commit. |
| **`git diff <commit-hash-1> <commit-hash-2>`** | Shows the exact changes between any two commits. |

-----

## 7\. Branching and Merging

Branches allow you to work on new features or revisions without affecting the main working code (`main` branch).

### Branch Workflow

1.  **Create a new branch:**
    ```bash
    git branch feature/new-notes-section
    ```
2.  **Switch to the new branch:**
    ```bash
    git switch feature/new-notes-section
    ```
    (You can combine these with `git checkout -b <branch-name>` in older Git.)
3.  **Work and Commit:** Make your changes and commit them locally on the new branch.
4.  **Merge the changes:** When ready, switch back to `main` and merge your changes:
    ```bash
    git switch main
    git merge feature/new-notes-section
    ```
5.  **Delete the merged branch:**
    ```bash
    git branch -d feature/new-notes-section
    ```

### Merge Conflicts

A **merge conflict** occurs when Git cannot automatically reconcile different changes made to the *same line* of the *same file* in two separate branches.

  * **Resolution Steps:**
    1.  Git will flag the conflicting file.
    2.  Open the file in VS Code (it provides tools to accept incoming or current changes).
    3.  Manually edit the file to the correct desired state.
    4.  **`git add <conflicting-file>`** (mark as resolved).
    5.  **`git commit -m "fix: Resolve merge conflict for X"`** (complete the merge).

## 🤝 Collaborating (Working with the Remote)

Collaboration involves connecting your local repository to the **remote** repository hosted on GitHub.

| Concept | Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Setup Remote** | `git remote add origin [URL]` | Links your local repo to the remote one (usually done once). |
| **Download Changes** | `git pull origin main` | **Fetches** changes from the remote and immediately **merges** them into your local branch. |
| **Upload Changes** | `git push origin main` | Uploads your local commits to the remote repository. |
