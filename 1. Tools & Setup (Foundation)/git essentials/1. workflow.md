## 📝 Git Workflow Essentials: Staging, Committing, and Pushing

This document outlines the standard workflow for updating your notes repository (`java-fsd-syllabus-notes`) and keeping it synchronized with the remote server (GitHub).

### 1. The Daily Cycle: **Edit, Stage, Commit, Push**

The Git workflow is a four-step process that ensures your changes are recorded locally and backed up remotely.

#### **Step 1: Edit (Work Locally)**

* **Action:** Open your VS Code editor and modify an existing note file (e.g., adding a new section to `sql_joins_cheatsheet.md`) or create a new file (e.g., `oop_concepts.md`).
* **Result:** The **Source Control** tab in VS Code will show the modified files under the **"Changes"** section.

#### **Step 2: Stage (Prepare the Snapshot)**

Staging tells Git exactly *which* changes you want to include in the next save point (commit).

| Action | Command Line | VS Code GUI |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Stage a single file** | `git add [file-name]` | Hover over the file in **Changes** and click the **`+` (Plus) icon**. |
| **Stage all modified files** | `git add .` | Click the **`+` (Plus) icon** next to the **"Changes"** heading. |
| **Result:** | Files move from **"Changes"** to the **"Staged Changes"** area. |

#### **Step 3: Commit (Save the Snapshot)**

Committing is the final local save point. Every commit must have a meaningful message describing the work done.

* **Rule:** Use **Conventional Commits** for clean history: `type: Subject Line`
    * `feat`: Adding a **new feature/concept** (e.g., finished a new note file).
    * `fix`: **Correcting an error** in existing notes.
    * `docs`: Updates to documentation (e.g., updating the **`README.md`** index).
* **Action:** Type the descriptive message in the **Commit Message box**.
* **Command Line:** `git commit -m "feat: Completed Spring Boot @RestController notes"`
* **VS Code GUI:** Click the **Commit** button.
* **Result:** The staged changes are permanently recorded in your local Git history.



#### **Step 4: Push (Upload to GitHub)**

Pushing sends your local commit history to the remote repository (GitHub), backing up your notes.

* **Action:** After committing, sync your local changes with the remote.
* **Command Line:** `git push origin main`
* **VS Code GUI:** Click the **"Sync Changes"** button (often an up/down arrow icon in the bottom status bar, or a dedicated button in the Source Control panel).
* **Result:** Your notes are now accessible remotely via the GitHub website.

### 2. Synchronization and Retrieving Notes

If you work on your notes from multiple devices, you need to ensure you pull the latest changes before starting work.

#### **Pulling Changes (Downloading)**

* **Purpose:** To retrieve any changes made to the repository from another location (e.g., if you edited the notes directly on GitHub's website or from a different computer).
* **Action:**
    * **Command Line:** `git pull origin main`
    * **VS Code GUI:** Click the **"Sync Changes"** button. VS Code will automatically pull first before pushing any local changes.
* **Best Practice:** Always run a `git pull` before you start a new note-taking session.

#### **Checking Status (Verifying)**

* **Purpose:** To see which files are modified and what the current branch status is.
* **Command Line:** `git status`
* **VS Code GUI:** The **Source Control** tab visually indicates modified, added, or deleted files. The bottom status bar shows how many commits you are ahead/behind the remote branch.

### 3. Recommended Commit Frequency

* **Commit Often:** Commit every time you finish a clear, self-contained concept or topic (e.g., finish your notes on "Spring Dependency Injection" and commit immediately).
* **Push Daily:** Push your changes to GitHub at least once a day or whenever you switch devices. **A local commit is not a cloud backup until you push!**
