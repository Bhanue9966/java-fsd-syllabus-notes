### 1. What is Docker?

**Docker** is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications using **containerization**.

* **Goal:** To solve the perennial problem of dependency and environment mismatch ("It works on my machine!") by packaging an application and its entire environment (dependencies, libraries, configurations) into a standardized unit called a **Container**.
* **Portability:** Once packaged, this container can run reliably and consistently on any host machine (laptop, server, cloud VM) that has the Docker engine installed.

### 2. Containers vs. Virtual Machines (VMs)

Before containers, **Virtual Machines (VMs)** were the standard solution for isolating environments. Docker containers offer significant advantages over traditional VMs:

| Feature | Containers (Docker) | Virtual Machines (VMs) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Isolation Layer** | **Operating System (OS) Kernel** | Hardware (via Hypervisor) |
| **OS Requirement** | No Guest OS required. Uses the Host OS kernel. | Requires a full, dedicated Guest OS (Windows/Linux). |
| **Size** | Very small (MBs). | Very large (GBs). |
| **Startup Time** | Seconds or milliseconds. | Minutes (requires OS boot). |
| **Overhead** | Low (shares host kernel resources). | High (requires full OS resources). |

### 3. Key Docker Components

#### A. Docker Image

A **Docker Image** is a read-only, static, executable package that contains everything needed to run an application—the code, runtime, libraries, environment variables, and config files.

* Images are built from a set of instructions defined in a **Dockerfile**.
* They are the blueprint for containers.

#### B. Docker Container

A **Docker Container** is a runnable instance of a Docker Image.

* It's a live, isolated, and running process on the Host machine.
* The container includes a thin, writable layer on top of the read-only Image, where the application stores runtime data and modifications.

### 4. Docker Architecture (Client-Server Model)

Docker uses a client-server architecture. The main components are the **Docker Client**, the **Docker Daemon**, and the **Docker Registry**.



#### A. Docker Daemon (The Server)

* The **Docker Daemon** (`dockerd`) runs as a service on the Host machine.
* It is the "brain" of Docker, responsible for building, running, and managing containers, images, networks, and volumes.

#### B. Docker Client

* The **Docker Client** (`docker`) is the primary way users interact with Docker.
* It communicates with the Daemon using a REST API (via UNIX sockets or a network interface).
* *Example command:* `docker run hello-world`

#### C. Docker Registry

* The **Docker Registry** is a centralized store for Docker Images.
* The default public registry is **Docker Hub**.
* The Daemon pulls (downloads) images from the Registry before running them and pushes (uploads) locally built images to the Registry.

This client-server structure allows you to manage Docker hosts remotely and provides the foundational mechanism for consistent container deployment.
