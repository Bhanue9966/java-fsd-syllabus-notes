# 🌐 7. Spring Web MVC and REST

### 🕸️ Web Application Fundamentals

A web application is any application accessed by users over a network (like the internet or an intranet) using a standard web browser. Understanding how they work is crucial before diving into Spring MVC.

### 1. Client-Server Architecture

Web applications follow a **Client-Server Architecture**.

* **Client:** Typically a web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge) that sends requests.
* **Server:** A web server (like Apache HTTP Server) or application server (like Tomcat, Jetty) that processes requests and sends back responses.

The communication happens using the **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**.

#### The Request-Response Cycle

1.  **Request:** The client (browser) sends a request (e.g., clicking a link or typing a URL) to the server. The request contains a **Method** (GET, POST, etc.) and a **URL** (Uniform Resource Locator).
2.  **Server Processing:** The server receives the request, processes the necessary logic (database access, business rules), and generates content.
3.  **Response:** The server sends a response back to the client. The response includes a **Status Code** (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found) and the **Response Body** (HTML, JSON, image, etc.).

### 2. Key Components in a Java Web App

For a Java application to act as a server, it relies on several core Java Enterprise Edition (EE) technologies:

#### A. Servlets

* A **Servlet** is a Java class used to extend the capabilities of a server. It is the fundamental, low-level component that handles incoming HTTP requests and generates responses.
* Every modern Java web framework, including Spring MVC, is built on top of the Servlet API.
* The primary method is **`service()`**, which typically delegates to methods like **`doGet()`** (for HTTP GET requests) and **`doPost()`** (for HTTP POST requests).

#### B. Web Container (Servlet Container)

* A **Web Container** (e.g., Apache Tomcat, Jetty) is the environment where servlets run.
* It manages the lifecycle of the servlets (initialization, execution, destruction) and handles the low-level concerns of socket connections, threading, and HTTP protocol parsing.
* In Spring Boot, the container (usually Tomcat) is **embedded**, meaning it runs directly within the application's executable JAR file.

#### C. `web.xml` (Deployment Descriptor)

* The `web.xml` file, historically mandatory, tells the container which **Servlets** to load and which **URL patterns** they should handle.
* **Modern Spring applications (especially Spring Boot) rarely use `web.xml`**; instead, configuration is done using Java code (specifically, the `WebApplicationInitializer` interface) and annotations.

### 3. Java Web App Deployment

A Java web application is typically packaged into a **WAR (Web Application Archive)** file.

* A WAR file is essentially a JAR file with a specific directory structure that includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript files, compiled classes, and libraries.
* The Web Container (like Tomcat) extracts the WAR file and deploys the application.
* **Spring Boot Alternative:** Spring Boot usually packages the application as an executable **JAR** file that contains the embedded web server, simplifying deployment.

### Summary of the Java Web Stack

| Layer | Technology | Spring Component | Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Server** | Web Container (Tomcat) | Embedded Server | Manages sockets, threads, and Servlet lifecycle. |
| **Protocol Handler** | Servlet API | DispatcherServlet | The single entry point for all requests in Spring MVC. |
| **Framework** | Spring MVC | `@Controller` | Handles application-specific request mapping and business flow. |
