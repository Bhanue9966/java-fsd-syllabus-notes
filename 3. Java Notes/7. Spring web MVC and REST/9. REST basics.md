### 🧱 Core Concepts of REST

**REST (Representational State Transfer)** is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It's not a protocol or a standard; it's a set of guiding principles that standardize how web services communicate.

The goal of REST is to achieve **scalability**, **simplicity**, and **modifiability** by making web services resemble the World Wide Web itself.

### 1\. Key REST Principles

| Principle | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Resource-Based** | Everything is treated as a **Resource**. Resources are identified by unique URIs. |
| **Statelessness** | Each client request from the client to the server must contain all the information needed to understand the request. The server cannot rely on previous requests or session state. |
| **Uniform Interface** | The way clients interact with the server is standardized via a set of fixed, well-defined operations (HTTP methods). |
| **Client-Server Separation** | The client (UI) and the server (data processing) are completely decoupled, allowing independent development. |

-----

### 2\. Resources and URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers)

In REST, a **Resource** is any concept, object, or piece of data that can be addressed (e.g., a customer, an order, or a product list).

  * **Bad URI (Action-based):** `/getAllCustomers`
  * **Good URI (Resource-based, Noun):** `/customers` (The resource is the collection of customers)
  * **Specific Resource:** `/customers/101` (A single instance of the customer resource)

### 3\. Using HTTP Methods for CRUD (Uniform Interface)

REST maps the standard **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations to the standard **HTTP Methods**. This is the core of the uniform interface.

| CRUD Operation | HTTP Method | URI Example | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Create** | `POST` | `/api/products` | Create a new product. Data is sent in the request body. |
| **Read (Retrieve)** | `GET` | `/api/products/{id}` | Retrieve a specific product. |
| **Read (List)** | `GET` | `/api/products` | Retrieve a list of products (often paginated/filtered). |
| **Update** | `PUT` | `/api/products/{id}` | Replace a resource entirely with new data. |
| **Update (Partial)** | `PATCH` | `/api/products/{id}` | Apply partial modifications to a resource. |
| **Delete** | `DELETE` | `/api/products/{id}` | Remove a specific resource. |

### 4\. Status Codes and Response Data

The server communicates the result of an operation using standard **HTTP Status Codes**. The response body usually contains the data in a format like **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)** or XML.

#### Common Response Status Codes

| Code | Meaning | Context |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **200 OK** | Success | Standard response for successful `GET`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, or `DELETE`. |
| **201 Created** | Success | Resource successfully created. Used after a successful **`POST`**. |
| **204 No Content** | Success | Server processed the request but there is no body to return. Often used for successful **`DELETE`**. |
| **400 Bad Request** | Client Error | Client sent invalid data (e.g., missing required fields, malformed JSON). |
| **404 Not Found**| Client Error | The requested resource URI does not exist. |
| **500 Internal Server Error** | Server Error | An unexpected error occurred on the server side. |

#### Example: JSON Response

When a client sends `GET /api/products/1`, the server returns:

  * **Status Code:** `200 OK`
  * **Response Body (JSON):**

<!-- end list -->

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Laptop Pro",
  "price": 1350.00
}
```
