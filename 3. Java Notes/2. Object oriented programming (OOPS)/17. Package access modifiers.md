## 17\. Packages and Access Modifiers

### 1\. Packages: Organization and Naming 📁

A **Package** is a mechanism in Java used to group related classes, interfaces, and sub-packages.

  * **Purpose:**

    1.  **Organization:** Prevents naming conflicts by creating namespaces (e.g., you can have two classes named `List` in different packages, like `java.util.List` and `com.app.model.List`).
    2.  **Access Control:** Packages are tied to the **`protected`** and **default** access modifiers.

  * **Naming Convention:** Package names should be all **lowercase** and based on the reverse order of your internet domain name to ensure uniqueness.

      * *Example:* If your domain is `example.com`, your package name might start with `com.example.app`.

  * **Usage:**

      * **Declaration:** The package statement must be the **very first** statement in a Java source file.
        ```java
        package com.myapp.model; 

        public class User { /* ... */ }
        ```
      * **Importing:** To use a class from another package, you must use the **`import`** statement.
        ```java
        import java.util.ArrayList; // Import a single class
        import java.io.*;          // Import all classes (*)
        ```

### 2\. Access Modifiers: Visibility and Control 🔒

**Access Modifiers** define the scope or visibility of a class, method, constructor, or variable. Java provides four types of access modifiers:

| Modifier | Accessible Within... | Same Class | Same Package | Subclass (Outside Pkg) | Other Package |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`private`** | **Class Only** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Default** (No keyword) | **Package Only** | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **`protected`** | **Package + Subclass** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| **`public`** | **Everywhere** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

#### Detailed Breakdown of Modifiers

#### A. `private`

  * **Restriction:** The member is only visible and accessible **inside its own class**.
  * **Use Case:** The foundation of **Encapsulation**. Class variables are typically declared `private` and accessed via public Getters and Setters.

#### B. Default (Package-Private)

  * **Restriction:** The member is visible only to other classes **within the same package**.
  * **Use Case:** When you want members to be invisible outside your local group of related classes.

#### C. `protected`

  * **Restriction:** The member is accessible within the **same package** OR by any **subclass** (even if the subclass is in a different package).
  * **Use Case:** When you want to allow special access only to immediate inheritors, enabling them to customize inherited behavior.

#### D. `public`

  * **Restriction:** The member is accessible from **everywhere** in the application.
  * **Use Case:** Typically used for the main class, public methods (APIs), and constants that must be universally available.
