## 12\. Inner Classes (Nested Classes)

An **Inner Class** is a class defined entirely within the body of another class. The class that encloses the inner class is called the **Outer Class**.

### 1\. Why Use Inner Classes?

1.  **Logical Grouping:** If a class is only useful to one other class, it's logical to embed it in that class. This enhances encapsulation.
2.  **Increased Encapsulation:** The inner class can access all members (including `private` members) of the outer class, allowing for tighter control over the data.
3.  **Code Readability:** Grouping related classes makes the code structure cleaner.

### 2\. Types of Inner Classes

There are four main types of inner classes in Java, categorized by how they are declared and where they are used:

| Type | Declaration | Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Nested Static Class** | Declared with the `static` keyword. | Used when the inner class does **not** need access to the outer class's instance members. |
| **2. Member Inner Class** | Declared inside the class body, outside any method. | Used when the inner class **does** need access to the outer class's instance members. |
| **3. Local Inner Class** | Defined inside a method or block. | Used when the class is needed only once, locally within a method. |
| **4. Anonymous Inner Class**| Defined and instantiated in a single expression; has no name. | Used for implementing a single method of an interface or abstract class on the fly. |

### 3\. Member Inner Class

This is the most standard type. It is tied to an instance of the outer class.

  * **Access:** It can access **all** members (private and non-private) of the outer class.
  * **Instantiation:** It requires an instance of the outer class to be created first.

#### Example

```java
public class OuterClass {
    private int outerData = 10;

    // 1. Member Inner Class Declaration
    class MemberInner {
        public void display() {
            // Accessing private member of outer class
            System.out.println("Outer Data is: " + outerData); 
        }
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Step 1: Create Outer Class instance
        OuterClass outer = new OuterClass();
        
        // Step 2: Create Inner Class instance using the outer instance
        OuterClass.MemberInner inner = outer.new MemberInner(); 
        
        inner.display(); // Output: Outer Data is: 10
    }
}
```

### 4\. Nested Static Class

The only inner class that is explicitly declared with the `static` keyword.

  * **Access:** It **cannot** access non-static (instance) members of the outer class. It can only access **static** members of the outer class.
  * **Instantiation:** It can be instantiated **without** creating an instance of the outer class.

#### Example

```java
public class OuterClass {
    private static int staticData = 20;

    // 2. Nested Static Class Declaration
    static class StaticNested {
        public void display() {
            // Accessing static member of outer class
            System.out.println("Static Data is: " + staticData); 
        }
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Direct instantiation using OuterClass name
        OuterClass.StaticNested inner = new OuterClass.StaticNested(); 
        
        inner.display(); // Output: Static Data is: 20
    }
}
```
