# 💡 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## 6\. Inheritance Basics

**Inheritance** is one of the four fundamental principles of OOP. It is the mechanism by which one class acquires the properties (fields) and behaviors (methods) of another class.

### 1\. The Principle of Inheritance 🌳

  * **Goal:** Promote **Code Reusability** and establish a **parent-child relationship** (also known as the **IS-A relationship**).
  * **Terminology:**
      * **Superclass (Parent Class):** The class whose features are being inherited.
      * **Subclass (Child Class):** The class that inherits the features.
  * **Keyword:** Java uses the **`extends`** keyword to achieve inheritance.

#### Syntax

```java
public class SubClass extends SuperClass {
    // SubClass now has all the public/protected members of SuperClass
    // Plus any new methods/fields defined here.
}
```

### 2\. The IS-A Relationship

Inheritance creates a hierarchy where the subclass is a specialized version of the superclass.

  * **Example:** A `Car` **IS-A** `Vehicle`. A `Dog` **IS-A** `Animal`.

<!-- end list -->

```java
// Parent Class (Superclass)
public class Vehicle {
    String engineType = "V6";
    
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Vehicle is running.");
    }
}

// Child Class (Subclass)
public class Car extends Vehicle {
    // Car inherits engineType and run() method
    String model = "Sedan"; 
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car myCar = new Car();
        
        System.out.println(myCar.engineType); // Inherited property: V6
        myCar.run();                          // Inherited behavior: Vehicle is running.
        System.out.println(myCar.model);      // Own property: Sedan
    }
}
```

### 3\. Types of Inheritance in Java

Java supports three main types of inheritance through classes:

| Type | Description | Achieved By |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Single** | A single subclass inherits from a single superclass. (The most common type) | `class B extends A` |
| **2. Multilevel** | A subclass inherits from a class, which itself inherits from another class. | `class C extends B` $\rightarrow$ `class B extends A` |
| **3. Hierarchical**| Multiple subclasses inherit from a single superclass. | `class B extends A`, `class C extends A` |

> 🛑 **Note on Multiple Inheritance:** Java **does not support Multiple Inheritance** through classes (a class cannot directly extend two or more classes). This is done to avoid the **Deadly Diamond of Death** (Dreaded Diamond Problem), where two parent classes have methods with the same signature, leading to ambiguity.

### 4\. What is Not Inherited?

  * **Constructors:** Constructors are special methods used for initializing objects and are **never** inherited by the subclass. However, the subclass constructor must call the superclass constructor (implicitly or explicitly via `super()`).
  * **Private Members:** Private members of the superclass are not directly accessible by the subclass. However, they are still present in the subclass object memory and can be accessed indirectly through public/protected methods (Getters/Setters) inherited from the superclass.
