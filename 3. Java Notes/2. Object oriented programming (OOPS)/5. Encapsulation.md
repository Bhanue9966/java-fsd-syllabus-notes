# 💡 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## 5\. Encapsulation, Getters, and Setters

**Encapsulation** is one of the four fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming. It is the mechanism that binds data (variables) and the code that manipulates the data (methods) together as a single unit, and keeps them safe from outside interference and misuse.

### 1\. The Principle of Encapsulation 🛡️

  * **Data Hiding:** The core idea is to hide the internal details of an object from the outside world. This is achieved by declaring instance variables as **`private`**.
  * **Controlled Access:** Access to these private variables is then provided indirectly through public methods, known as **Getter** and **Setter** methods.

#### How to Achieve Encapsulation in Java:

1.  Declare the instance variables of a class as **`private`**.
2.  Provide public **Getter** methods to **read** (access) the variable values.
3.  Provide public **Setter** methods to **write** (modify) the variable values.

### 2\. Getters (Accessors)

A **Getter** method (or Accessor) is used to retrieve (get) the value of a private field.

  * **Naming Convention:** Starts with `get`, followed by the variable name (in PascalCase), e.g., `getEmployeeName()`.
  * **Return Type:** Returns the data type of the variable it is accessing.
  * **Parameters:** Takes **no** parameters.

<!-- end list -->

```java
public class Employee {
    private String name; // Private field

    // Getter method to READ the name
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
    // ... more code
}
```

### 3\. Setters (Mutators)

A **Setter** method (or Mutator) is used to change or set the value of a private field.

  * **Naming Convention:** Starts with `set`, followed by the variable name (in PascalCase), e.g., `setEmployeeName()`.
  * **Return Type:** Typically **`void`** (it performs an action, it doesn't return a value).
  * **Parameters:** Takes **one** parameter of the same data type as the field being set.

<!-- end list -->

```java
public class Employee {
    private int salary; // Private field

    // Setter method to WRITE/MODIFY the salary
    public void setSalary(int newSalary) {
        // ENCAPSULATION BENEFIT: We can add validation logic here!
        if (newSalary > 0) {
            this.salary = newSalary;
        } else {
            System.out.println("Error: Salary must be positive.");
        }
    }
}
```

### 4\. Benefits of Encapsulation

1.  **Flexibility and Control:** You can control **how** data is accessed and modified. In the Setter example above, we added logic to prevent a negative salary from being set. You cannot do this if the field is public.
2.  **Maintainability:** If you change the internal representation of data (e.g., changing `int salary` to `double monthlySalary`), you only need to update the Getter/Setter logic. External code calling `setSalary()` remains unchanged.
3.  **Data Hiding (Security):** Data is protected from direct, unintended manipulation from outside the class.
