# 💡 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## 8\. The `this` and `super` Keywords in Inheritance

Both **`this`** and **`super`** are reference variables used to access members of a class. The difference lies in which class they reference:

| Keyword | Refers To... | Primary Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`this`** | The **current object** (current class instance). | Resolving local/instance variable name conflicts. |
| **`super`** | The **immediate parent object** (superclass instance). | Accessing members (variables/methods/constructors) of the superclass. |

### 1\. The `super` Keyword

The `super` keyword is used specifically within a **subclass** to refer to members of its **immediate superclass**.

#### A. Accessing Superclass Variables

Use `super.variableName` when the subclass has a local or instance variable with the same name as a variable in the superclass (shadowing).

```java
class Animal {
    String color = "White";
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    String color = "Black"; // Dog's color shadows Animal's color
    
    void printColor() {
        System.out.println("Dog color: " + color);        // Refers to Dog's color (Black)
        System.out.println("Animal color: " + super.color); // Refers to Animal's color (White)
    }
}
```

#### B. Accessing Superclass Methods

Use `super.methodName()` to explicitly call a method from the superclass, especially when that method has been **overridden** in the subclass.

```java
class Vehicle {
    void accelerate() {
        System.out.println("Vehicle acceleration started.");
    }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    @Override
    void accelerate() {
        super.accelerate(); // Calls the Vehicle's accelerate() method
        System.out.println("Car is accelerating smoothly.");
    }
}
```

#### C. Calling Superclass Constructor (`super()`)

A subclass constructor must always call the constructor of its superclass, either implicitly or explicitly. Use `super()` to explicitly call a superclass constructor.

  * **Rule:** `super()` must be the **very first statement** in the subclass constructor.

<!-- end list -->

```java
class Parent {
    Parent(String name) {
        System.out.println("Parent created: " + name);
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    Child(String name) {
        // Explicitly calling the Parent's parameterized constructor
        super(name); 
        System.out.println("Child created.");
    }
}
// If the Parent had a no-arg constructor, super() would be called automatically.
```

### 2\. The `this()` vs. `super()` Call

It's important to differentiate the constructor calls:

| Call | Purpose | Where it Points | Rule |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`this()`** | Used for **Constructor Chaining** within the **same class**. | Another constructor in the **current class**. | Must be the first statement. |
| **`super()`** | Used for **Constructor Chaining** to initialize the parent part. | A constructor in the **immediate superclass**. | Must be the first statement. |

> ⚠️ **You Cannot Do Both:** Since both `this()` and `super()` must be the first statement in a constructor, you **cannot use both** in the same constructor. You must choose one. (If you use `this()`, the constructor called by `this()` will implicitly or explicitly call `super()`.)
