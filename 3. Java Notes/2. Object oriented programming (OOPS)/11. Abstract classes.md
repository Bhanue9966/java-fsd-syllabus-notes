# 💡 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## 11\. Abstract Classes and Methods

**Abstract classes** and **abstract methods** are essential tools in OOP for achieving abstraction, the process of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential information to the user.

### 1\. Abstract Class

An **Abstract Class** is a class that is declared with the `abstract` keyword.

  * **Purpose:** To serve as a base class or blueprint for subclasses, providing some common methods while forcing subclasses to implement others.
  * **Instantiation Rule:** You **cannot create objects** (instantiate) of an abstract class. It must be inherited (`extended`) by a concrete subclass.
  * **Contents:** It can contain a mix of:
      * **Abstract methods** (methods without a body).
      * **Concrete methods** (regular methods with a body).
      * Variables, constructors, and nested classes.

#### Syntax

```java
public abstract class Shape {
    // Concrete method
    public void printInfo() {
        System.out.println("This is a 2D shape.");
    }
    
    // Abstract method (no body)
    public abstract double calculateArea(); 
}
```

### 2\. Abstract Method

An **Abstract Method** is a method that is declared without an implementation (without a body).

  * **Purpose:** To define a method signature (a contract) that all non-abstract subclasses **must** override and implement.
  * **Rule:** Any class that contains at least one abstract method **must** be declared as an abstract class.

#### Implementation Rule

If a non-abstract (concrete) class extends an abstract class, it **must provide an implementation** for every single abstract method declared in the superclass. If it fails to do so, the subclass must also be declared abstract.

#### Example: Enforcing Implementation

```java
// Abstract Class (cannot be instantiated)
public abstract class Employee {
    
    // Abstract method: forces all subclasses to define how pay is calculated
    public abstract double calculatePay(); 
}

// Concrete Subclass (must implement calculatePay)
public class FullTimeEmployee extends Employee {
    private double salary = 50000;
    
    @Override
    public double calculatePay() {
        return salary / 12; // Specific implementation for salary
    }
}
```

### 3\. Abstract Class vs. Interface

While they both help achieve abstraction and define a contract, they have key differences:

| Feature | Abstract Class | Interface |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Keyword** | `abstract class` | `interface` |
| **Multiple Inheritance** | **Not supported** (Class can only extend one). | **Supported** (Class can implement multiple). |
| **Constructors** | Can have constructors (used by subclasses via `super()`). | Cannot have constructors. |
| **Methods** | Can have abstract, concrete, `static`, and `final` methods. | Historically only abstract. Now can have `default` and `static` methods (Java 8+). |
| **Variables** | Can have `private`, `protected`, `public` variables. | Variables are implicitly `public static final` (constants). |
