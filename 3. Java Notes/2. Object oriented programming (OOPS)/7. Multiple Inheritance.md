# 💡 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## 7\. Multiple Inheritance (The Java Approach)

### 1\. The Multiple Inheritance Problem

As established in the previous section, Java **does not support multiple inheritance with classes**. A Java class can only inherit from a single superclass.

  * **Why?** To avoid the **Deadly Diamond of Death (Dreaded Diamond Problem)**.
      * Imagine Class C extends both Class A and Class B. If both A and B have a method named `process()`, and C calls `process()`, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) won't know **which version** of `process()` to inherit and execute (A's or B's). This ambiguity leads to complex runtime errors.

### 2\. Solving the Problem with Interfaces

Java achieves the *effect* of multiple inheritance by using **Interfaces**.

An **Interface** is a completely abstract type that defines a contract: it specifies what methods a class must implement.

  * **Keyword:** A class uses the **`implements`** keyword to inherit from one or more interfaces.

#### The Rules of Java Inheritance

| Entity | `extends` (Inheritance) | `implements` (Interface) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Class** | Can only **`extend` one** class. | Can **`implement` multiple** interfaces. |
| **Interface**| Can **`extend` multiple** interfaces. | Cannot implement anything. |

### 3\. Practical Multiple Inheritance via Interfaces

By implementing multiple interfaces, a single class can acquire multiple contracts (behaviors) without inheriting any conflicting implementation details (data or method bodies).

```java
// Interface 1 (Contract 1)
public interface Flyable {
    void fly(); // Abstract method
}

// Interface 2 (Contract 2)
public interface Swimmable {
    void swim(); // Abstract method
}

// Class can implement multiple interfaces (achieving multiple inheritance of BEHAVIOR)
public class Duck implements Flyable, Swimmable {
    
    // Duck must provide implementation for both methods
    @Override
    public void fly() {
        System.out.println("Duck is flying.");
    }

    @Override
    public void swim() {
        System.out.println("Duck is swimming.");
    }
}
```

  * **How it Solves the Diamond Problem:** Interfaces only contain method **signatures** (the "what to do"), not the method **body** (the "how to do it"). The implementing class (`Duck`) is responsible for providing the concrete "how," thus there is no ambiguity about which code to run.
