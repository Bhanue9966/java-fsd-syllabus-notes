# 💡 Object-Orienthed Programming (OOP)

## 4\. Constructor (Default vs Parameterized) and Anonymous Object

### 1\. The Constructor

A **Constructor** is a special type of method used to **initialize** the state (variables) of an object at the time of its creation.

  * **Rule 1: Name Match:** The constructor name **must be exactly the same** as the class name.
  * **Rule 2: No Return Type:** Constructors do **not** have a return type, not even `void`.
  * **Rule 3: Invoked with `new`:** It is automatically called when you create an object using the `new` keyword.

### 2\. Types of Constructors

Constructors are classified based on whether they accept parameters.

#### A. Default Constructor (No-Argument Constructor)

A constructor that accepts no arguments.

1.  **Compiler-Provided (Implicit):** If you do **not** define any constructor in your class, the Java compiler automatically inserts a public, no-argument constructor during compilation. This is the **Default Constructor**.
2.  **User-Defined:** If you define *any* constructor (even a parameterized one), the compiler will **not** provide the default one, so you must define the no-argument constructor yourself if you need it.

<!-- end list -->

```java
public class Bike {
    String color;
    
    // User-Defined Default Constructor
    public Bike() {
        color = "Black"; // Initialize with a default value
        System.out.println("Bike created with default color.");
    }
}
```

#### B. Parameterized Constructor

A constructor that accepts one or more arguments (parameters).

  * **Purpose:** To initialize the object's fields with values supplied at the time of object creation. This is the most common and robust way to ensure an object starts in a valid state.

<!-- end list -->

```java
public class Bike {
    String color;
    int maxSpeed;
    
    // Parameterized Constructor
    public Bike(String color, int maxSpeed) {
        // Using 'this' keyword to differentiate parameter from instance variable
        this.color = color;
        this.maxSpeed = maxSpeed;
    }
}

// How to use it:
// Bike myBike = new Bike("Red", 150); 
```

### 3\. Constructor Overloading

Just like methods, a class can have multiple constructors, provided they have different parameter lists (different number, type, or order of arguments).

```java
public class Bike {
    String color;
    
    // 1. Constructor 1: Default
    public Bike() { 
        this("White"); // Calls Constructor 2: Constructor Chaining
    }
    
    // 2. Constructor 2: Parameterized (String only)
    public Bike(String color) {
        this.color = color;
    }
}
```

### 4\. Anonymous Object

An **Anonymous Object** is an object that is created **without a reference variable** (no name). Since it has no name, it can only be used once immediately after creation.

  * **Lifetime:** They are quickly cleaned up by the Garbage Collector after their single use.
  * **Use Case:** Often used when you need to call a method immediately but don't need to keep the object in memory for later use.

#### Syntax

$$\text{new ClassName().methodCall();}$$

#### Example

Instead of:

```java
// 1. Named object (lives longer)
Book myBook = new Book();
myBook.read();
```

Use the Anonymous Object:

```java
// 2. Anonymous object (used once)
new Book().read(); // Object created just to call 'read()' and then destroyed.

// It is also used when passing objects as arguments:
// printDetails(new Employee("Alice")); 
```
