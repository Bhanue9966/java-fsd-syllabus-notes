# 💡 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## 13\. Interfaces

An **Interface** is a blueprint of a class. It is a completely abstract type used to define a **contract** of behavior that implementing classes must adhere to.

### 1\. The Principle of Interfaces 📜

  * **Keyword:** Interfaces are declared using the `interface` keyword.
  * **Purpose:** To achieve **total abstraction** and support **multiple inheritance of behavior** (solving the Diamond Problem).
  * **Instantiation Rule:** You **cannot** create objects of an interface.
  * **Implementation:** A class uses the **`implements`** keyword to adopt an interface.

### 2\. Interface Members (Before Java 8)

Historically, interfaces were very restrictive. All members were implicitly defined with strict modifiers:

| Member Type | Implicit Modifiers | Behavior |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Methods** | `public abstract` | They have no body; implementing classes **must** provide the body. |
| **Variables** | `public static final` | They are constants; they must be initialized at declaration. |

### 3\. Java 8 and Beyond (Evolved Interfaces)

Java 8 introduced new features to enhance interfaces without breaking the principle of contracts:

#### A. Default Methods

These methods allow you to add **concrete method implementations** directly into an interface.

  * **Purpose:** To safely add new methods to an existing interface without forcing all implementing classes (which might be in different libraries) to update and implement the new method immediately.
  * **Keyword:** Declared with the **`default`** keyword.

<!-- end list -->

```java
public interface LoggingService {
    // Abstract method (must be implemented)
    void logMessage(String message);
    
    // Default method (provides a default implementation)
    default void logTime() {
        System.out.println("Time: " + System.currentTimeMillis());
    }
}
```

#### B. Static Methods

Interfaces can also have `static` methods.

  * **Purpose:** To provide utility methods related to the interface that can be called directly on the interface itself (e.g., `List.of()`) without requiring an implementing object.

### 4\. Interface Inheritance (Extending)

An interface can extend **one or more** other interfaces. This allows you to combine contracts.

  * **Keyword:** Interfaces use **`extends`** to inherit from other interfaces.

<!-- end list -->

```java
// Combining contracts
public interface AdvancedCalculator extends BasicCalculator, ScientificCalculator {
    // ... adds more methods
}
```

### 5\. Abstract Class vs. Interface (Recap)

| Feature | Abstract Class | Interface |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Multiple Parents** | **Single** inheritance (can only `extend` one class). | **Multiple** inheritance (can `implement` many interfaces). |
| **Constructors** | Can have constructors. | Cannot have constructors. |
| **Methods (Concrete)** | Can have regular methods (`public`, `private`, etc.). | Can only have `default` or `static` methods (Java 8+). |
| **Variables** | Can have any variable type (`private`, `int`, etc.). | Variables are implicitly `public static final`. |
