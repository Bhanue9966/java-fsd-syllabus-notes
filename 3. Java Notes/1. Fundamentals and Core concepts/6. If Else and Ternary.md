## 6\. If Else / If Else If / Ternary Operator

**Control Flow** refers to the order in which statements are executed in a program. **Conditional statements** allow your program to make decisions and execute different code blocks based on whether a condition is `true` or `false`.

### 1\. The `if-else` Statement

The fundamental decision-making structure.

  * **`if`:** Executes a block of code only if the condition is `true`.
  * **`else`:** Executes a block of code if the `if` condition is `false`.

#### **Syntax**

```java
if (condition) {
    // Code to execute if the condition is TRUE
} else {
    // Code to execute if the condition is FALSE
}
```

#### **Example**

```java
int score = 75;

if (score >= 70) {
    System.out.println("You Passed!");
} else {
    System.out.println("You Failed.");
}
```

### 2\. The `if-else if-else` Ladder

Used when you need to check multiple, mutually exclusive conditions sequentially.

  * The conditions are checked from top to bottom.
  * As soon as one condition evaluates to `true`, its associated block is executed, and the entire ladder is exited (the rest of the conditions are not checked).
  * The final **`else`** block acts as the **default** or "catch-all" block if none of the preceding conditions were met.

#### **Syntax**

```java
if (condition1) {
    // executes if condition1 is TRUE
} else if (condition2) {
    // executes if condition1 is FALSE AND condition2 is TRUE
} else if (condition3) {
    // executes if condition1 & condition2 are FALSE AND condition3 is TRUE
} else {
    // executes if ALL previous conditions are FALSE
}
```

#### **Example: Grading System**

```java
int marks = 85;

if (marks >= 90) {
    System.out.println("Grade: A");
} else if (marks >= 80) {
    // Executes because 85 >= 80 is true
    System.out.println("Grade: B");
} else {
    System.out.println("Grade: C");
}
```

### 3\. The Ternary Operator (Conditional Operator)

The **ternary operator** is a concise way to write a simple `if-else` statement. It takes three operands and is the only ternary operator in Java.

It is often used to assign a value to a variable based on a single condition.

#### **Syntax**

$$\text{Variable} = (\text{Condition}) \text{ ? } (\text{Value if True}) \text{ : } (\text{Value if False});$$

#### **Example**

**Traditional `if-else`:**

```java
int age = 19;
String status;

if (age >= 18) {
    status = "Adult";
} else {
    status = "Minor";
}
System.out.println(status);
```

**Using the Ternary Operator:**

```java
int age = 19;
// Condition is (age >= 18)
String status = (age >= 18) ? "Adult" : "Minor";

System.out.println(status); // Output: Adult
```
