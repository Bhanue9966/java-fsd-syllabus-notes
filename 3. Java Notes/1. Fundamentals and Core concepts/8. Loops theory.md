## 8. Need for Loop / Which Loop To Use

### 1. The Need for Loops (Iteration)

In programming, a **loop** is a control structure that allows a block of code to be executed repeatedly as long as a certain condition is met. This repetitive execution is called **iteration**.

#### 🛑 Why are Loops Necessary?

Imagine you need to print the numbers 1 through 100 or process 50 records from a database. Without loops, you would have to write the same line of code 100 or 50 times!

Loops solve the problem of **redundancy** by enabling you to:

* **Execute code multiple times:** Perform the same task efficiently without copy-pasting code.
* **Process collections:** Iterate over arrays, lists, or other data structures.
* **Perform calculations:** Repeat steps until a specific result (like finding a prime number or calculating compound interest) is reached.

### 2. General Loop Structure

Every loop in Java has four main components:

1.  **Initialization:** Setting up a counter variable (usually an integer). This happens only **once** at the start.
    * *Example:* `int i = 0;`
2.  **Condition (Test Expression):** A boolean expression that is checked **before** each iteration. If it's `true`, the loop continues; if it's `false`, the loop terminates.
    * *Example:* `i < 10;`
3.  **Body:** The block of statements inside the loop that gets executed during each iteration.
4.  **Update/Iteration:** The statement that modifies the counter variable (e.g., increments or decrements it) to ensure the loop eventually terminates.
    * *Example:* `i++;`

### 3. Types of Loops in Java

Java provides four main loop structures, each optimized for different situations:

| Loop Type | Primary Use Case | Condition Check Timing |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`for` loop** | When you know the **exact number of iterations** (e.g., loop 10 times). | At the **start** of the loop. |
| **Enhanced `for`** | To iterate over arrays or collections (also called "for-each"). | N/A (Iterates over elements). |
| **`while` loop** | When the number of iterations is **unknown**, and you need the condition checked **before** the first run. | At the **start** of the loop. |
| **`do-while` loop** | When the number of iterations is **unknown**, and you must execute the body at least **once**. | At the **end** of the loop. |

### 4. Which Loop To Use?

Selecting the right loop makes your code clearer and more efficient.

| Situation | Recommended Loop | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Iterating 1 to N times** (Fixed count) | **`for` loop** | All control parts (init, condition, update) are placed neatly on one line. |
| **Iterating over an Array/Collection** | **Enhanced `for` loop** | Simplifies the code and eliminates the need for an index variable. |
| **Repeating until a user enters 'quit'** (Unknown count, check first) | **`while` loop** | The loop condition naturally depends on external input; if the condition is false initially, the loop body shouldn't run. |
| **Executing a menu option at least once** (Unknown count, execute first) | **`do-while` loop** | Ensures the block runs once (e.g., displaying a menu) before checking the condition to see if it should repeat. |
