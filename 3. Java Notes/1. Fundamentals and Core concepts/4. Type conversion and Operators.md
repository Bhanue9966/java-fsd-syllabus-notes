## 3\. Variables, Data Types, and Literals

This section covers the fundamental building blocks of any Java program: how to store data and what kind of data you can store.

### 1\. Variables: Your Data Containers

A **variable** is essentially a name given to a **memory location**. It acts as a container that holds a specific type of data, and its value can be changed throughout the program's execution.

  * **Declaration:** Specifying the type and name of the variable.
    ```java
    dataType variableName;
    ```
  * **Initialization:** Assigning a value to the variable for the first time.
    ```java
    int age = 30; // 'age' is the variable name, 30 is the value.
    ```

### 2\. Data Types: Defining the Data

A **data type** determines the size and type of values a variable can hold. Java is a **statically-typed language**, meaning you must declare the variable's type before you use it.

Java has two main categories of data types:

#### A. Primitive Data Types

These are the most basic types, predefined in Java, and they store the **actual value** directly in memory. They are always lowercase.

| Type | Default Value | Size (Bytes) | Range / Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `byte` | 0 | 1 | Stores whole numbers from -128 to 127. |
| `short` | 0 | 2 | Stores whole numbers up to $\approx \pm 32,000$. |
| **`int`** | 0 | 4 | **Most common** type for whole numbers. |
| `long` | 0L | 8 | Used for very large whole numbers (e.g., timestamps). |
| **`float`** | 0.0f | 4 | Single-precision floating-point (decimal) numbers. |
| **`double`** | 0.0d | 8 | **Default** for decimal numbers; double-precision (more accurate). |
| **`char`** | `\u0000` | 2 | Stores a single **Unicode character** (e.g., 'A', '$'). |
| **`boolean`** | `false` | $\approx$ 1 bit | Stores only `true` or `false`. |

#### B. Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types

These types **do not** store the value directly. Instead, they store a **memory address (a reference)** that points to where the object's data is actually stored.

  * **Examples:** **`String`**, **`Array`**, **`Class`**, **`Interface`**.
  * They are created by the programmer (except for `String` and `Array`, which have special status) and always start with an **uppercase** letter.

### 3\. Literals: The Fixed Values

A **literal** is a fixed value that is represented directly in your source code. It's the notation used to write values.

| Literal Type | Examples | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Integer** | `10`, `12345` | By default, an integer literal is treated as an **`int`**. Use `L` for a `long` literal: `5000000000L`. |
| **Floating-Point** | `10.5`, `2.718` | By default, a floating-point literal is treated as a **`double`**. Use `f` for a `float` literal: `3.14f`. |
| **Character** | `'a'`, `'@'`, `'\n'` | Must be enclosed in **single quotes** (`' '`). Can use escape sequences (like `\n` for newline). |
| **String** | `"Hello World"`, `""` | Must be enclosed in **double quotes** (`" "`). Strings are technically objects (non-primitive). |
| **Boolean** | `true`, `false` | Only these two keywords are allowed. |
| **Null** | `null` | Used for reference types to indicate no object is referenced. Primitives cannot be `null`. |

#### Example: Understanding Literals and Variables

```java
public class LiteralExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // 1. Integer literal (default int)
        int maxSpeed = 120;
        
        // 2. Long literal (must use L)
        long earthPop = 8000000000L;
        
        // 3. Floating-point literal (default double)
        double pi = 3.14159;
        
        // 4. Character literal
        char grade = 'A';
        
        // 5. String literal (object reference type)
        String message = "Java is fun!"; 
        
        // 6. Boolean literal
        boolean isComplete = true; 
    }
}
```
