## 9\. While Loop and Do-While Loop

### 1\. The `while` Loop

The **`while` loop** is the most basic loop in Java. It is an **entry-controlled loop**, meaning the condition is checked **before** the body of the loop is executed.

  * **Key Feature:** The loop body may execute **zero or more times**. If the condition is false initially, the body is skipped entirely.
  * **Best Use:** When you don't know the exact number of iterations and the loop must only run if the starting condition is true (e.g., repeating input until a specific keyword is entered).

#### Syntax

```java
// Initialization (must be done before the loop)
while (condition) {
    // Loop Body
    // 1. Statements to be executed
    
    // 2. Update/Iteration step (to eventually make the condition false)
}
```

#### Example

```java
int count = 1;

// Loop continues as long as count is less than or equal to 5
while (count <= 5) { 
    System.out.println("Current count: " + count);
    
    // The update step
    count++; 
} 
// Output: Current count: 1 to 5
```

### 2\. The `do-while` Loop

The **`do-while` loop** is an **exit-controlled loop**. This means the body of the loop is executed **at least once** before the condition is checked.

  * **Key Feature:** The loop body is **always executed at least once**, regardless of whether the condition is true or false initially.
  * **Best Use:** Scenarios where you need one guaranteed run, such as displaying a menu to a user and then asking if they want to repeat the action.
  * **Note:** The `while` condition ends with a semicolon (`;`).

#### Syntax

```java
do {
    // Loop Body (executed at least once)
    // 1. Statements to be executed
    
    // 2. Update/Iteration step
} while (condition); // Condition check is done here (ends with a semicolon)
```

#### Example

```java
int i = 6;

do {
    System.out.println("The value is: " + i);
    i++;
} while (i <= 5); // The condition (6 <= 5) is FALSE.

// Output: The value is: 6
// The loop ran once even though the condition was immediately false.
```

### 3\. Comparison: `while` vs. `do-while`

| Feature | `while` Loop | `do-while` Loop |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Control** | Entry-Controlled (Condition checked at the start) | Exit-Controlled (Condition checked at the end) |
| **Minimum Runs** | **Zero** or more times. | **One** or more times. |
| **Semicolon** | No semicolon after the `while(condition)` line. | Semicolon (`;`) is required after the `while(condition)` line. |
