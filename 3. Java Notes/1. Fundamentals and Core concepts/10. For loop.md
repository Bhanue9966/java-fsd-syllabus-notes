## 10\. For Loop and Enhanced For Loop

The **`for` loop** is the most widely used loop in Java, primarily because its structure allows the initialization, condition check, and update steps to be defined cleanly on a single line.

### 1\. The Standard `for` Loop

The standard `for` loop is ideal when you know the **exact number of iterations** you need to perform.

#### Syntax

The control components are separated by semicolons (`;`):

```java
for (initialization; condition; update) {
    // Code block to be executed repeatedly
}
```

| Component | Execution | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Initialization** | Executes **only once** at the beginning of the loop. | `int i = 0` |
| **Condition** | Checked **before** every iteration. If `true`, the loop continues. | `i < 10` |
| **Update** | Executes **after** the loop body runs, typically to increment/decrement the counter. | `i++` |

#### Example: Counting Up

```java
// Print numbers from 1 to 5
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    System.out.println("Iteration: " + i);
} 
// Output: 
// Iteration: 1
// ...
// Iteration: 5
```

### 2\. The Enhanced `for` Loop (For-Each Loop)

Introduced in Java 5, the **Enhanced `for` Loop** (often called the **For-Each Loop**) is designed to simplify iteration over elements in **Arrays** and **Collections**.

  * **Key Feature:** It automatically manages the index/counter. It's concise and less error-prone when simply reading elements.

#### Syntax

```java
for (dataType elementVariable : arrayOrCollection) {
    // Code block that uses the elementVariable
}
```

#### Example: Iterating over an Array

```java
String[] names = {"Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"};

// Iterate over each String element in the names array
for (String name : names) { 
    System.out.println("Hello, " + name);
}

// Output:
// Hello, Alice
// Hello, Bob
// Hello, Charlie
```

> **🛑 Limitation:** The enhanced `for` loop is great for reading data, but you **cannot use it to modify** the elements of an array/collection or iterate backward, as it does not expose the index.

### 3\. 🤔 Which Loop to Use When?

Choosing the correct loop for a task often comes down to two questions: **Do you know the count?** and **Do you need a guaranteed first run?**

| Scenario | Recommended Loop | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fixed Number of Times** (e.g., 10 times, length of array) | **Standard `for` Loop** | All control logic (`i=0`, `i<N`, `i++`) is consolidated and visible in one place. Best for index-based iteration. |
| **Iterating over Data Structures** (Arrays, Lists) | **Enhanced `for` Loop** | Simplest syntax for reading all elements in sequence. Reduces index-related errors. |
| **Condition-Controlled (Check First)** (e.g., repeating until a file's end is reached) | **`while` Loop** | The number of runs is unknown, and the loop might not run at all if the starting condition is false. |
| **Guaranteed Execution (Check Last)** (e.g., processing user input or showing a menu) | **`do-while` Loop** | Ensures the code block runs at least once before checking the exit condition for subsequent runs. |
