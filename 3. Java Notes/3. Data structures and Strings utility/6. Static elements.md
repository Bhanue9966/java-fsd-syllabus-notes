## 6\. Static Elements: Variables, Methods, and Blocks

The **`static` keyword** is a non-access modifier used to manage memory efficiently and to allow access to members without needing an instance (object) of the class.

A member declared as `static` belongs to the **class itself**, not to any specific object of that class.

### 1\. Static Variables (Class Variables)

A variable declared with the `static` keyword is known as a **static variable** or a **class variable**.

  * **Memory:** Static variables are stored in the **Class Area** (part of the Heap/Metaspace), and memory is allocated only **once** when the class is loaded by the JVM.
  * **Sharing:** All objects of that class share the **single copy** of the static variable. Changing the value via one object changes it for all objects.
  * **Access:** They can be accessed using the class name, although they can also be accessed via an object reference. Accessing via the class name (`ClassName.variableName`) is the recommended practice.
  * **Use Case:** Ideal for representing common properties of all objects (e.g., a counter for how many objects have been created, or a constant like `PI`).

<!-- end list -->

```java
public class Employee {
    // Instance variable (one copy per object)
    String name;
    
    // Static variable (one copy shared by all Employee objects)
    static String company = "TechCorp"; 
    static int employeeCount = 0;

    public Employee(String name) {
        this.name = name;
        Employee.employeeCount++; // Accessing static variable via class name
    }
}
```

### 2\. Static Methods

A method declared with the `static` keyword is known as a **static method** or a **class method**.

  * **Access:** They can be called directly using the class name (`ClassName.methodName()`) without needing to create an object.
  * **Restriction (The Core Rule):** A static method **cannot** use non-static members (variables or methods) of the class. This is because non-static members belong to an *instance* which may not exist when the static method is called.
  * **Use Case:** Utility methods that don't rely on the state of a specific object (e.g., `Math.sqrt()`, `Integer.parseInt()`). The `main` method must always be static.

<!-- end list -->

```java
public class Utility {
    static int globalValue = 10;
    int instanceValue = 5; // Non-static member

    public static void displayGlobal() {
        // Accessing static variable is OK
        System.out.println("Global: " + globalValue); 
        
        // System.out.println(instanceValue); // ERROR: Cannot access non-static member
    }
}
```

### 3\. Static Block

A **static initialization block** is a block of statements enclosed in curly braces (`{}`) and preceded by the `static` keyword.

  * **Execution:** It is executed **exactly once** when the class is first loaded into memory by the JVM, before any objects are created or any static methods are called.
  * **Purpose:** Used to initialize complex static data structures or perform tasks that only need to happen once (e.g., logging configuration, initializing static final fields).

<!-- end list -->

```java
public class AppConfig {
    public static final String DB_URL;
    
    static {
        // This block runs once when AppConfig is loaded
        DB_URL = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/prod_db";
        System.out.println("Database URL initialized.");
        // Add complex initialization logic here...
    }
}
```
