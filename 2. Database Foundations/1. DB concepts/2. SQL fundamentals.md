### 1\. Introduction to Database, SQL, and MySQL

| Term | Definition | Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Database** | An organized collection of structured data. | Stores the information (the tables, views, etc.). |
| **SQL** | **Structured Query Language**. The standard language used to interact with a relational database. | The tool/language used to manage and query the data. |
| **MySQL** | A popular **Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)**. | The software that physically hosts and runs the database. |

### 2\. Rules for Writing SQL Queries

SQL is **case-insensitive** for commands (though capitalization is strongly recommended for readability) but often **case-sensitive** for string data (depending on the database configuration).

1.  **Use Keywords in UPPERCASE:** Always write SQL keywords (e.g., `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`) in uppercase to distinguish them from table and column names.
2.  **Terminate Statements:** Every SQL statement must end with a **semicolon (`;`)**. This allows you to submit multiple statements in a single batch.
3.  **String Values:** Enclose all string (text) values within **single quotes (`'`)**.
      * *Example:* `WHERE last_name = 'Smith'`
4.  **Formatting:** Use indentation and line breaks to make complex queries easy to read and debug.

### 3\. Naming Conventions

Consistent naming is critical for maintainability in large schema designs.

| Element | Convention | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Table Names** | **Plural nouns**, often **PascalCase** or **snake\_case**. | `Customers`, `product_orders` |
| **Column Names** | **Singular nouns**, **snake\_case** (all lowercase with underscores). | `first_name`, `order_date`, `is_active` |
| **Primary Keys** | Usually `id` or `table_name_id`. | `customer_id` |
| **Foreign Keys** | Usually `referenced_table_id`. | `dept_id` (in the `employees` table) |

### 4\. Comments in SQL Language

Comments are non-executable text used to explain code or temporarily disable statements.

| Comment Type | Syntax | Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Single-Line Comment** | `-- [Your comment here]` | Explaining a specific line or temporary notes. |
| **Multi-Line/Block Comment** | `/* [Your comment here] */` | Commenting out large blocks of code or providing header documentation. |

```sql
-- SQL Comment Examples

/*
    This query retrieves employee data
    who work in the 'Sales' department.
*/
SELECT
    first_name,
    salary  -- Displaying the employee's salary
FROM
    Employees
WHERE
    dept_id = 101;
```

## 5\. SQL Command Types and Explanation (Overview)

SQL commands are grouped into five main categories based on their function. The subsequent notes files will cover the syntax for each command in detail.

| Command Type | Full Form | Purpose | Key Commands |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **DDL** | **Data Definition Language** | Defines, changes, and removes the structure (schema) of the database. | `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`, `TRUNCATE`, `RENAME` |
| **DML** | **Data Manipulation Language** | Handles access to and manipulation of the data within the tables. | `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` |
| **DCL** | **Data Control Language** | Manages user access and permissions to the database. | `GRANT`, `REVOKE` |
| **TCL** | **Transaction Control Language** | Manages transactions (units of work) to ensure data integrity. | `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, `SAVEPOINT` |
| **DQL** | **Data Query Language** | Strictly retrieves data from the database. It is often considered a subset of DML. | `SELECT` |

## 6\. Launching and Operating on the Database (MySQL)

These initial steps are crucial for setting up your environment, the detailed instructions and screenshots will be covered in **`02_setup_basics/01_workbench_ops.md`**.

### Launch MySQL Workbench

1.  Open the MySQL Workbench application.
2.  The home screen displays existing connections.

### Connect to MySQL Server

1.  Click on the local instance connection (e.g., `Local Instance MySQL80`).
2.  Enter your password (if required).
3.  This opens the **SQL Editor**, where you write and execute queries.

### Creating a New Database

You can create a new database either through the GUI (Navigator panel) or using a DDL command.

```sql
-- DDL Syntax to Create a Database
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS my_revision_db;

-- Command to use the newly created database
USE my_revision_db;
```

> **Note:** The `USE` command tells MySQL which database schema subsequent DML/DDL commands should be executed against.
