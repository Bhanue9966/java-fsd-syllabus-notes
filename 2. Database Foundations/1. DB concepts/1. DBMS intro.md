### 1\. Introduction to DBMS

A **Database** is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system.

A **Database Management System (DBMS)** is software that interacts with the user, applications, and the database itself to capture and analyze data.

#### Key Advantages of a DBMS

1.  **Data Consistency:** Ensures data is uniform across all data stores.
2.  **Redundancy Control:** Eliminates the duplication of data (e.g., storing a customer's address only once).
3.  **Data Security:** Provides access control mechanisms (user permissions).
4.  **Data Integrity:** Enforces rules and constraints to ensure data accuracy.
5.  **Data Sharing:** Allows multiple users and applications to access the same database concurrently.

### 2\. Components of a DBMS

A DBMS is a complex system, but its primary components are:

1.  **Query Processor:** Interprets user commands and translates them into instructions for the low-level components.
2.  **Storage Manager (or Buffer Manager):** Manages the storage of data (indexing, file management, buffer memory allocation).
3.  **Database:** The actual physical collection of data files.
4.  **Database Access Languages:** **SQL** (Structured Query Language) is the primary language used to define and manipulate data.

### 3\. Real-World Applications of SQL

Since the late 1970s, **SQL** has been the standard language for relational databases and is the backbone of most large-scale data systems.

| Sector | Application | Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Banking/Finance** | Transaction Systems | Managing millions of daily deposits, withdrawals, and account balances. |
| **E-Commerce** | Inventory/Order Management| Tracking products, managing customer orders, and processing payments. |
| **Airlines** | Reservation Systems | Handling bookings, seat availability, and flight schedules in real-time. |
| **Healthcare** | Electronic Health Records | Storing patient history, diagnoses, and treatment plans securely. |

### 4\. Basic Rules and Naming Conventions

While specific conventions vary, following these best practices makes SQL queries readable and maintainable.

| Concept | Rule/Convention | SQL Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Keywords** | Use **UPPERCASE** for all SQL commands (e.g., `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`). | `SELECT * FROM Orders;` |
| **Table/Column Names** | Use **snake\_case** (lowercase, words separated by underscores). | `customer_id`, `product_details` |
| **Query Formatting** | Break up complex queries onto multiple lines for readability. | See example below. |

```sql
-- SQL Query Formatting Example
SELECT
    e.first_name,
    d.dept_name
FROM
    Employees e
INNER JOIN
    Departments d ON e.dept_id = d.id
WHERE
    e.salary > 70000;
```
