## 🔗 SQL Joins

Joins are fundamental operations in Structured Query Language (SQL) used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. They are essential for leveraging the power of **relational database management systems (RDBMS)**.

-----

### 1\. Why Joins are Necessary

In a properly designed relational database (one following normalization rules), data is intentionally split into smaller, logical tables to eliminate redundancy and improve data integrity.

  * **Example:** Employee details are stored in the `Employees` table, and department details are stored in the `Departments` table. The two tables are linked by the **Foreign Key** (`dept_id`) in the `Employees` table pointing to the **Primary Key** (`dept_id`) in the `Departments` table.
  * **The Problem:** If you want a report that lists the employee's name next to their full department name, you must use a join to temporarily combine the relevant information from both tables.

### 2\. Basic Join Syntax

The standard ANSI SQL syntax for joining tables is the most explicit and readable method.

```sql
SELECT
    column1,
    column2,
    ...
FROM
    table1
[JOIN_TYPE] table2
ON
    join_condition
WHERE
    filter_condition;
```

#### A. The `FROM` and `JOIN` Clauses

The `FROM` clause specifies the starting table. The `JOIN` clause specifies the second table and the type of relationship.

```sql
-- Syntax demonstrating table structure
FROM Employees          -- Left table (A)
INNER JOIN Departments  -- Join Type and Right table (B)
```

#### B. The `ON` Clause (The Join Condition)

The `ON` clause is mandatory for most join types and explicitly defines the relationship between the two tables, usually linking the Foreign Key to the Primary Key.

```sql
-- Example using ON
ON Employees.dept_id = Departments.dept_id
```

### 3\. Improving Readability with Table Aliases

Using full table names in complex queries becomes cumbersome. **Table Aliases** (temporary short names) are essential for concise and readable join statements.

```sql
SELECT
    E.first_name,
    D.dept_name
FROM
    Employees AS E -- Assigning alias E
INNER JOIN
    Departments AS D -- Assigning alias D
ON
    E.dept_id = D.dept_id; -- Using aliases in the condition
```

-----

### 4\. Alternative Join Condition Syntax (`USING`)

If the join columns in both tables have the **exact same name** and you are performing an **equi-join** (joining using the `=` operator), you can use the `USING` clause as a shorthand.

```sql
-- Prerequisites: Both tables must have a column named 'dept_id'
SELECT
    E.first_name,
    D.dept_name
FROM
    Employees AS E
INNER JOIN
    Departments AS D
USING (dept_id); -- Implicitly performs: E.dept_id = D.dept_id
```
