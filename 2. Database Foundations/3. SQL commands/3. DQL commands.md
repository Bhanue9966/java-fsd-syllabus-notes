### 1\. SELECT Command (The Core of DQL)

The `SELECT` statement is used to specify which columns to retrieve from which tables, and under what conditions.

#### A. Basic Selection and Projection

This defines the columns (the *projection*) you want to see.

```sql
-- Syntax (Selecting specific columns)
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;

-- Syntax (Selecting all columns)
SELECT *
FROM table_name;

-- Example: Retrieve the full name and salary of every employee
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary
FROM Employees;
```

#### B. Using Aliases

Column aliases (using the optional `AS` keyword) make result set columns more readable, especially when performing calculations or functions.

```sql
-- Syntax (Column aliasing)
SELECT column_name AS alias_name, expression AS calculated_alias
FROM table_name;

-- Example: Combine names and calculate annual bonus
SELECT
    first_name || ' ' || last_name AS Full_Name,
    salary,
    salary * 0.15 AS Annual_Bonus
FROM Employees;
```

#### C. Removing Duplicates (`DISTINCT`)

The `DISTINCT` keyword ensures that only unique rows are returned in the result set.

```sql
-- Syntax
SELECT DISTINCT column1
FROM table_name;

-- Example: Find all unique department IDs present in the Employees table
SELECT DISTINCT dept_id
FROM Employees;
```

### 2\. Filtering Data (WHERE Clause)

The `WHERE` clause is used to filter records based on specified criteria.

```sql
-- Syntax
SELECT columns
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

#### A. Comparison Operators

Used to compare values. (`=`, `!=` or `<>`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`)

```sql
-- Example: Employees with salary greater than or equal to 70000
SELECT *
FROM Employees
WHERE salary >= 70000;
```

#### B. Logical Operators

Used to combine multiple conditions (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`).

```sql
-- Example: Employees in department 101 AND hired before 2024
SELECT *
FROM Employees
WHERE dept_id = 101 AND hire_date < '2024-01-01';
```

#### C. Special Operators

| Operator | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **BETWEEN** | Checks if a value is within a range (inclusive). | `salary BETWEEN 60000 AND 80000` |
| **IN** | Checks if a value matches any value in a list or subquery. | `dept_id IN (101, 103, 105)` |
| **LIKE** | Searches for a specified pattern in a column (using wildcards). | `last_name LIKE 'Smi%'` |
| **IS NULL** | Checks for null values. | `phone_number IS NULL` |

```sql
-- Example: Find all employees whose last name starts with 'B'
SELECT *
FROM Employees
WHERE last_name LIKE 'B%';

-- Example: Find all employees hired in the year 2024
SELECT *
FROM Employees
WHERE hire_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-12-31';
```

-----

### 3\. Sorting Data (ORDER BY Clause)

The `ORDER BY` clause is used to sort the result set by one or more columns.

```sql
-- Syntax
SELECT columns
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1 [ASC|DESC], column2 [ASC|DESC], ...;

-- Example: Sort by salary (highest first), then by last name (alphabetical)
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary
FROM Employees
ORDER BY salary DESC, last_name ASC;
```

-----

### 4\. Grouping and Aggregation (GROUP BY & HAVING Clauses)

These clauses are used to summarize data into groups using aggregation functions (e.g., `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`).

#### A. GROUP BY

Groups rows that have the same values in the specified column(s) into a summary row.

```sql
-- Syntax
SELECT grouping_column, AGGREGATE_FUNCTION(column)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY grouping_column;

-- Example: Find the average salary for each department
SELECT
    dept_id,
    AVG(salary) AS Average_Salary,
    COUNT(*) AS Total_Employees
FROM Employees
GROUP BY dept_id;
```

#### B. HAVING

The `HAVING` clause is used to filter groups created by the `GROUP BY` clause. The `WHERE` clause filters *rows* before grouping; `HAVING` filters *groups* after grouping.

```sql
-- Syntax
SELECT columns
FROM table_name
GROUP BY grouping_column
HAVING aggregate_condition;

-- Example: Find departments where the average salary is above 75000
SELECT
    dept_id,
    AVG(salary) AS Average_Salary
FROM Employees
GROUP BY dept_id
HAVING AVG(salary) > 75000.00;
```

### 5\. Joining Tables (The Power of Relational Data)

The `JOIN` clause combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them (typically a Foreign Key).

| Join Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **INNER JOIN** | Returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables. |
| **LEFT JOIN** | Returns all rows from the left table, and the matched rows from the right table (NULLs where no match exists). |
| **RIGHT JOIN** | Returns all rows from the right table, and the matched rows from the left table (NULLs where no match exists). |
| **FULL JOIN** | Returns rows when there is a match in one of the tables (often simulated using LEFT + RIGHT UNION). |

```sql
-- Syntax (INNER JOIN)
SELECT columns
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.matching_column = table2.matching_column;

-- Example: Retrieve employee name along with their department name
SELECT
    E.first_name,
    E.last_name,
    D.dept_name
FROM Employees AS E -- Use aliases E and D for brevity
INNER JOIN Departments AS D
ON E.dept_id = D.dept_id;
```

```
