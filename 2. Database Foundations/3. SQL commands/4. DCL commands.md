## 🛠️ Data Control Language (DCL) Commands 

Data Control Language (DCL) commands are used to manage and control access permissions (privileges) to the database objects. These commands are critical for database security and ensuring that only authorized users or roles can perform specific operations. DCL operations are generally **automatically committed**.

-----

### 1\. GRANT Command

The `GRANT` command is used to give specific privileges to a user or a role.

#### A. Granting Object Privileges

Object privileges apply to specific database objects like tables, views, or stored procedures.

```sql
-- Syntax (Granting one or more privileges on an object)
GRANT privilege_name [, privilege_name, ...]
ON object_name
TO user_or_role_name [, user_or_role_name, ...];

-- Example 1: Granting SELECT (read) access on the Employees table to user 'analyst1'
GRANT SELECT
ON Employees
TO analyst1;

-- Example 2: Granting INSERT and UPDATE permissions on the Departments table to role 'HR_Admin'
GRANT INSERT, UPDATE
ON Departments
TO HR_Admin;

-- Example 3: Granting the ability to update only the 'salary' column (column-level grant)
GRANT UPDATE (salary)
ON Employees
TO HR_Manager;
```

#### B. Granting All Privileges

The `ALL PRIVILEGES` keyword grants all standard privileges applicable to the object.

```sql
-- Example: Granting all privileges on the Projects table to 'dev_team' role
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES
ON Projects
TO dev_team;
```

#### C. Granting Privileges with the Option to Transfer (`WITH GRANT OPTION`)

This clause allows the specified user or role to then grant those same privileges to other users or roles.

```sql
-- Example: User 'senior_dba' can now grant SELECT access on Employees to others
GRANT SELECT
ON Employees
TO senior_dba
WITH GRANT OPTION;
```

#### D. Granting System Privileges

System privileges are broader permissions required to perform actions across the database, such as creating a session or creating a table.

```sql
-- Example: Granting the privilege to create a new session in the database
GRANT CREATE SESSION
TO new_user;

-- Example: Granting the privilege to create tables in the database
GRANT CREATE TABLE
TO dev_user;
```

-----

### 2\. REVOKE Command

The `REVOKE` command is used to remove specific privileges that were previously granted to a user or a role.

#### A. Revoking Object Privileges

```sql
-- Syntax (Revoking one or more privileges on an object)
REVOKE privilege_name [, privilege_name, ...]
ON object_name
FROM user_or_role_name [, user_or_role_name, ...];

-- Example 1: Revoking the INSERT privilege on the Projects table from user 'intern'
REVOKE INSERT
ON Projects
FROM intern;

-- Example 2: Revoking all privileges previously granted on the Employees table
REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES
ON Employees
FROM junior_dev;
```

#### B. Revoking Privileges that were Granted with Transfer Option

When revoking a privilege that was granted with `WITH GRANT OPTION`, the keyword `CASCADE` or `RESTRICT` is often required (depending on the database vendor) to handle privileges that the revokee might have subsequently granted to others.

```sql
-- Example (Standard SQL/MySQL syntax for revoking the grant option)
REVOKE GRANT OPTION FOR SELECT
ON Employees
FROM senior_dba;

-- Example (Oracle/PostgreSQL syntax might use CASCADE)
REVOKE SELECT ON Employees FROM senior_dba CASCADE;
```

#### C. Revoking System Privileges

```sql
-- Example: Revoking the ability for 'new_user' to create new tables
REVOKE CREATE TABLE
FROM new_user;
```

-----

### 3\. Role Management (Conceptual DCL)

Many SQL systems include commands to manage **Roles**, which are collections of privileges that can be granted to users. This simplifies administration.

#### A. Creating a Role

```sql
-- Syntax
CREATE ROLE role_name;

-- Example
CREATE ROLE Project_Manager;
```

#### B. Granting Privileges to a Role

```sql
-- Grant SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE permissions on a table to the new role
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
ON Tasks
TO Project_Manager;
```

#### C. Granting a Role to a User

```sql
-- Assign the newly configured role to a specific user
GRANT Project_Manager
TO user_john_doe;
```

#### D. Dropping a Role

```sql
-- Syntax
DROP ROLE role_name;

-- Example
DROP ROLE Project_Manager;
```

```
