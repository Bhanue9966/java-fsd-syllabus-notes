## 🎨 Introduction to ER Diagrams

**Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagrams** are visual tools used during the **conceptual design phase** of database development. They represent the high-level data requirements of an organization by graphically illustrating the relationships between different data elements. An ER model helps to clarify the structure of the data before the specific tables and keys are implemented in the database.

The core purpose of an ER diagram is to model the real-world components that an organization tracks.

## 🛠️ Rules for Constructing ER Models

The construction of a robust ER model follows specific rules based on three core components: **Entities**, **Attributes**, and **Relationships**. 

### 1. Entities and Attributes

* **Rule 1: Identify Key Entities.**
    * Entities represent the main objects or concepts (e.g., **Customer**, **Product**, **Order**). They are typically nouns and are drawn as **rectangles**.
* **Rule 2: Determine Key Attributes.**
    * Each entity must have a **Primary Key** (key attribute) that uniquely identifies it (e.g., `CustomerID`). Key attributes are underlined in the model.
* **Rule 3: Maintain Atomicity.**
    * All simple attributes should be **atomic** (indivisible). For instance, split `Address` into `Street`, `City`, and `ZIP`.
* **Rule 4: Handle Multi-Valued Attributes.**
    * Attributes that can have multiple values (e.g., multiple phone numbers for one person) must be extracted and treated as a new **separate entity** linked by a 1:N relationship.

### 2. Relationships (Cardinality and Participation)

The relationship defines the association between two entities.

* **Rule 5: Define Relationship Name and Verb.**
    * Relationships are typically verbs (e.g., `Customer` **PLACES** `Order`). They are drawn as **diamonds**.
* **Rule 6: Determine Cardinality (The Number of Links).**
    * Specify how many instances of one entity can be associated with another. This defines the nature of the link:
        * **One-to-One (1:1):** e.g., A `Car` is registered to one `License Plate`.
        * **One-to-Many (1:N):** e.g., A `Department` **HAS** many `Employees`.
        * **Many-to-Many (M:N):** e.g., A `Student` **ENROLLS** in many `Courses`.
* **Rule 7: Determine Participation (Optionality).**
    * Specify whether an entity instance is required (total participation) or optional (partial participation) in the relationship.
        * **Total Participation (Mandatory):** Shown by a **double line**. (e.g., Every `Employee` **must** be assigned to a `Department`).
        * **Partial Participation (Optional):** Shown by a **single line**. (e.g., A `Professor` **may** advise a `Student`).

### 3. Mapping Rules (Conceptual to Relational)

These rules dictate how the conceptual model transitions to the physical schema.

* **Rule 8: Map 1:N Relationships.**
    * The **Foreign Key (FK)** is placed on the **"Many" side** of the relationship, referencing the Primary Key of the "One" side.
* **Rule 9: Map M:N Relationships.**
    * M:N relationships are resolved by creating a new **Junction Table**. This new table's Primary Key is usually a **Composite Key** consisting of the Primary Keys of the two original entities.
* **Rule 10: Map 1:1 Relationships.**
    * The Foreign Key can be placed on either entity, though it's often placed on the side with optional participation to minimize null values.
