## 🔒 ACID Properties

The **ACID** properties are a set of guarantees that a Database Management System (DBMS) must satisfy to ensure that database **transactions** are processed reliably. They are the foundation of data integrity, especially in multi-user environments where concurrency and failures are common.

### 1. What is a Transaction?

A **Transaction** is a sequence of one or more database operations (like `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`) executed as a single, logical unit of work. The goal is that this unit of work must either be completed entirely or not completed at all.

* **Boundary:** A transaction starts implicitly (e.g., when the first DML statement runs) or explicitly (`BEGIN TRANSACTION`) and ends when it is either **committed** or **rolled back**.
    * **`COMMIT`**: Makes all changes permanent in the database.
    * **`ROLLBACK`**: Undoes all changes since the transaction started.

### 2. The ACID Acronym

The acronym ACID stands for **Atomicity**, **Consistency**, **Isolation**, and **Durability**. 

#### A. Atomicity (All or Nothing)

**Atomicity** guarantees that a transaction is treated as a single, indivisible unit. If any part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction fails, and the database state is reverted to the point before the transaction began.

* **Principle:** Either all changes from the transaction are applied to the database, or none of them are.
* **Example (Bank Transfer):** Transferring \$100 from Account A to Account B requires two steps:
    1.  Debit \$100 from Account A.
    2.  Credit \$100 to Account B.
    If the system fails after step 1 but before step 2, Atomicity ensures that the debit to A is automatically undone (`ROLLBACK`).

#### B. Consistency (Valid State Transition)

**Consistency** guarantees that any transaction will move the database from one valid state to another. This means that any data written to the database must be valid according to all defined rules, constraints, and business logic.

* **Principle:** The transaction must respect all Primary Keys, Foreign Keys, `CHECK` constraints, and business rules (e.g., balance cannot be negative).
* **Example:** If a rule states that a `salary` column cannot be `NULL`, a transaction attempting to set `salary` to `NULL` will be aborted (`ROLLBACK`), preserving the database's consistent state.

#### C. Isolation (Independent Execution)

**Isolation** guarantees that concurrent execution of transactions leaves the database in the same state that would have been obtained if the transactions were executed sequentially (one after the other).

* **Principle:** Transactions must appear to run independently of each other. A transaction reading data should not see the intermediate, uncommitted changes made by another concurrent transaction.
* **Implementation:** Achieved through concurrency control mechanisms like locking.
* **Isolation Levels:** SQL allows different degrees of isolation (e.g., Read Committed, Serializable) to balance consistency requirements with performance needs.

#### D. Durability (Persistence)

**Durability** guarantees that once a transaction has been successfully **committed**, its changes are permanent and will survive any subsequent system failure (e.g., power loss, crash, or reboot).

* **Principle:** Committed data is permanently recorded on non-volatile storage (like a hard drive).
* **Mechanism:** DBMS typically use transaction logs (journals) to ensure that committed data can be recovered even if the data pages haven't been written from memory to disk yet.
* **Example:** After the bank transfer is committed, even if the database server immediately crashes, the \$100 debit and credit will be present when the system recovers.

### 3. ACID and TCL

The **Transaction Control Language (TCL)** commands are the primary way a user interacts with the ACID properties:

* **`COMMIT`**: Ensures **Durability**.
* **`ROLLBACK`**: Enables **Atomicity**.
* The DBMS ensures **Consistency** and **Isolation** throughout the transaction life cycle.
