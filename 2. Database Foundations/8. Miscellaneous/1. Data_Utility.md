## 🛠️ Data Utility Concepts 

This file covers two essential features that simplify common data management tasks: automatically generating primary keys and performing flexible pattern-based searches.

-----

### 1\. Auto Increment (Identity/Serial)

**Auto Increment** is a feature that allows a numeric field (typically the Primary Key) to automatically generate a unique, sequential number every time a new record is inserted into a table.

#### A. Purpose

  * **Guaranteed Uniqueness:** Ensures every row has a unique identifier, crucial for Primary Keys.
  * **Simplicity:** Developers don't need to manually calculate or look up the next available ID.

#### B. Syntax Examples (Vendor Differences)

The implementation syntax for auto-incrementing columns varies significantly across different DBMS vendors:

| Database | Syntax Keyword | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **MySQL** | `AUTO_INCREMENT` | `customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT` |
| **SQL Server** | `IDENTITY(seed, increment)` | `order_id INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1, 1)` |
| **PostgreSQL**| `SERIAL` or `GENERATED AS IDENTITY` | `product_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY` |

```sql
-- MySQL Example: Creating a table with an Auto Increment primary key
CREATE TABLE Users (
    user_id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (user_id)
);

-- Insertion (We omit the user_id column)
INSERT INTO Users (username) VALUES ('alice_j');
-- The user_id is automatically assigned 1, 2, 3, etc., on subsequent inserts.
```

-----

### 2\. LIKE Clause (Pattern Matching)

The **`LIKE`** clause is used in the `WHERE` statement to search for a specified pattern within string column values. It is often used for fuzzy text searching where exact matches are not expected.

#### A. Wildcard Characters

The `LIKE` operator relies on specific wildcard characters:

| Wildcard | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`%` (Percent)** | Represents any sequence of **zero or more** characters. | `LIKE 'J%n'` matches 'Jan', 'John', 'Jonathan'. |
| **`_` (Underscore)**| Represents **any single character**. | `LIKE 'B_ll'` matches 'Bill' or 'Ball' but not 'Bibll' or 'Bil'. |

#### B. Usage Examples

```sql
-- Example 1: Finding all employees whose last name starts with 'Sm'
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM Employees
WHERE last_name LIKE 'Sm%';

-- Result: 'Smith', 'Smythe', 'Small'

-- Example 2: Finding all products that have 'steel' anywhere in their name
SELECT product_name
FROM Products
WHERE product_name LIKE '%steel%';

-- Result: 'Stainless Steel Mug', 'Steel Rods', 'Blue Steel'

-- Example 3: Finding names that are exactly 5 characters long and end with 'a'
SELECT city_name
FROM Locations
WHERE city_name LIKE '____a'; -- Four underscores followed by 'a'

-- Result: 'Tampa', 'Osaca', 'Delhi' (If Delhi were 5 chars)

-- Example 4: Escaping a literal wildcard character (e.g., searching for a name with an actual percent sign)
SELECT part_number
FROM Inventory
WHERE part_number LIKE '100\%' ESCAPE '\';
-- The backslash (\) tells the engine to treat the next character (%) literally.
```

#### C. Case Sensitivity

The behavior of the `LIKE` clause regarding case sensitivity depends on the database configuration (collation). By default:

  * **MySQL (Default):** `LIKE` is often **case-insensitive**.
  * **PostgreSQL, SQL Server:** `LIKE` is often **case-sensitive** (unless configured otherwise). PostgreSQL offers the **`ILIKE`** operator for explicit case-insensitive matching.
