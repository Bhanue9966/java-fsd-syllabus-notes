## 💾 Operational Concepts 

This file covers **Database Backup**, a critical operational concept that ensures data recoverability and business continuity in the event of hardware failure, corruption, or human error.

### 1. Database Backup

A **Database Backup** is a consistent copy of data files, control files, and transaction logs taken at a specific point in time. It is the only reliable way to recover a database to a previous, usable state.

#### A. Purpose
* **Disaster Recovery:** Recovering the database after catastrophic hardware failure or a natural disaster.
* **Data Corruption:** Restoring data after logical corruption (e.g., bad application code or malicious activity).
* **Archiving:** Retaining historical data for compliance or auditing.

#### B. Types of Backups

Database systems (like SQL Server, Oracle, and PostgreSQL) offer different backup strategies to balance recovery speed, storage space, and backup time.

| Backup Type | Description | Best Used When... |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Full Backup** | Creates a copy of the **entire database**. It is the foundation for all other backups. | Data changes infrequently, or maximum safety/quickest restore is needed. |
| **Differential Backup** | Captures all changes made since the **last full backup**. | Used daily, as it is faster than a full backup and restores quickly (requires only the last full + the latest differential). |
| **Incremental Backup** | Captures only the changes made since the **last *any* backup** (full, differential, or incremental). | Used when disk space is severely limited, but restoration is complex (requires the full backup + every subsequent incremental backup in sequence). |

#### C. Recovery Models (Transaction Log)

The chosen **Recovery Model** dictates how a database handles its **transaction log** and, consequently, what recovery options are available.

1.  **Full Recovery Model:**
    * Saves all transaction details in the log.
    * Allows point-in-time recovery (down to the second) but requires frequent transaction log backups.
2.  **Simple Recovery Model:**
    * Automatically truncates (deletes) the inactive log portion when checkpoints occur, saving disk space.
    * Allows recovery only to the time of the last full or differential backup, not to a specific moment in time.

#### D. Essential Backup Concepts

* **Recovery Point Objective (RPO):** The maximum tolerable amount of data that can be lost following a failure (e.g., losing 1 hour of data). A full recovery model with frequent transaction log backups reduces the RPO.
* **Recovery Time Objective (RTO):** The target time frame for restoring business operations after a disaster. A reliable backup strategy with fast hardware ensures a low RTO.
* **Testing:** Backups are useless unless they are **tested** regularly via a full restore to a separate environment. This is the only way to verify integrity.
