## 💻 MySQL Workbench Operations (`02_setup_basics/01_workbench_ops.md`)

MySQL Workbench is the official graphical user interface (GUI) tool for administering MySQL environments and writing/executing SQL queries.

### 1\. Launching MySQL Workbench

1.  **Open the Application:** Locate and launch **MySQL Workbench** on your operating system (Windows/macOS/Linux).
2.  **Home Screen:** The application opens to the home screen, which lists all configured **MySQL Connections** (represented by tiles).

### 2\. Connecting to a MySQL Server

A connection is a stored profile containing the necessary credentials and address to reach a specific MySQL database instance (local or remote).

1.  **Select Connection:** Click on an existing connection tile (e.g., **`Local Instance MySQL80`**).
2.  **Authentication:** You may be prompted to enter the password for the database user (typically `root`).
3.  **SQL Editor:** Once authenticated, the **SQL Editor** window opens. This is your primary workspace for writing and running queries.

### 3\. Operations on Databases (Schema Management)

A database in MySQL is referred to as a **Schema**. You must first create and then select a schema before you can create tables inside it.

#### A. Creating a New Database

You can create a new schema using either the GUI or a DDL command.

| Method | Instructions | SQL Command Syntax |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **GUI** | 1. In the **Schema Navigator** panel (left side), right-click and select **"Create Schema..."** 2. Enter the name (e.g., `java_fsd_db`). 3. Click **"Apply"**. | \`\`\`sql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS java\_fsd\_db;

````|

#### B. Selecting a Database

Before any DDL (like creating a table) or DML (like inserting data) can be executed, you must tell the server which database to target.

| Method | Instructions | SQL Command Syntax |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **GUI** | In the **Schema Navigator**, double-click the schema name (`java_fsd_db`). It will become **bold**, indicating it is the active schema. | ```sql
USE java_fsd_db;
``` |

#### C. Deleting (Dropping) a Database

This is a permanent operation that deletes the schema and all tables and data within it. Use with extreme caution.

| Method | Instructions | SQL Command Syntax |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **GUI** | 1. Right-click the schema name (`java_fsd_db`) in the Navigator. 2. Select **"Drop Schema..."** 3. Confirm the deletion. | ```sql
DROP DATABASE java_fsd_db;
``` |

### 4. Executing SQL Queries

In the SQL Editor pane:

1.  Type your query (e.g., a `CREATE TABLE` or `SELECT` statement).
2.  To execute a single query, click the **lightning bolt** icon next to the query (or press **`Ctrl + Enter` / `Cmd + Enter`**).
3.  To execute all queries in the editor, click the larger **lightning bolt** icon in the main toolbar.
4.  Results appear in the **Output Grid** below the editor.
