### 1\. SQL Data Types (MySQL)

Data types define the kind of data a column can hold (e.g., numbers, text, dates) and the amount of memory allocated for it. Choosing the correct data type is crucial for performance and data integrity.

| Category | Data Type | Description | Usage Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Numeric** | **INT** | A normal-sized integer (whole number). | `age INT` |
| | **DECIMAL (M, D)** | Exact numeric data type. `M` is total digits, `D` is digits after the decimal point. | `price DECIMAL(5, 2)` (e.g., 999.99) |
| | **FLOAT / DOUBLE** | Approximate numeric data types (for high-precision, non-critical calculations). | `latitude DOUBLE` |
| **String** | **CHAR (size)** | Fixed-length string. If data is shorter, it's padded with spaces. (Fast but less flexible). | `country_code CHAR(2)` |
| | **VARCHAR (size)** | Variable-length string. Saves space but requires 1-2 bytes overhead. (Most common). | `name VARCHAR(255)` |
| | **TEXT** | Stores large strings (up to 65,535 characters). | `product_description TEXT` |
| **Date/Time** | **DATE** | Stores the date only (YYYY-MM-DD). | `hire_date DATE` |
| | **TIME** | Stores the time only (HH:MM:SS). | `alarm_time TIME` |
| | **DATETIME** | Stores both date and time (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS). | `created_at DATETIME` |
| **Boolean** | **BOOLEAN** | A synonym for **TINYINT(1)**. Stores `0` (False) or `1` (True). | `is_active BOOLEAN` |

```sql
-- DDL Example: Using Data Types in a Table Creation
CREATE TABLE Products (
    product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    unit_price DECIMAL(6, 2),
    is_available BOOLEAN,
    last_updated DATETIME
);
```

### 2\. SQL Operators

**Operators** are reserved words or characters used primarily in the `WHERE` and `HAVING` clauses to perform operations, such as comparisons and logical combinations.

#### A. Arithmetic Operators

Used to perform mathematical calculations on numeric columns.

| Operator | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`+`** | Addition |
| **`-`** | Subtraction |
| **`*`** | Multiplication |
| **`/`** | Division |
| **`%`** | Modulo (Remainder) |

```sql
-- Example: Calculate commission (Salary * 0.10)
SELECT
    name,
    salary * 0.10 AS commission
FROM
    Employees;
```

#### B. Comparison Operators

Used to compare two expressions or values. These are typically used in the `WHERE` clause to filter data.

| Operator | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`=`** | Equal to |
| **`!=`** or **`<>`** | Not equal to |
| **`>`** | Greater than |
| **`<`** | Less than |
| **`>=`** | Greater than or equal to |
| **`<=`** | Less than or equal to |

```sql
-- Example: Employees with salary greater than or equal to 60000
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE salary >= 60000;
```

#### C. Logical Operators

Used to combine conditions in a query's `WHERE` or `HAVING` clauses.

| Operator | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`AND`** | Returns TRUE if **all** conditions are TRUE. |
| **`OR`** | Returns TRUE if **at least one** condition is TRUE. |
| **`NOT`** | Inverts the result of the boolean expression (from TRUE to FALSE and vice-versa). |

```sql
-- Example: Combining conditions
SELECT *
FROM Products
WHERE category = 'Electronics' AND price < 500;
```

#### D. Special Operators

Used for specific filtering tasks that cannot be handled by simple comparison.

| Operator | Description | Syntax Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`BETWEEN`** | Tests if a value is within a range (inclusive). | `WHERE age BETWEEN 20 AND 30` |
| **`IN`** | Tests if a value matches any value in a list of values. | `WHERE city IN ('London', 'Paris')` |
| **`LIKE`** | Used for pattern matching using wildcards (`%` for any string, `_` for any single character). | `WHERE name LIKE 'A%'` (starts with 'A') |
| **`IS NULL`** | Tests for a NULL value (note: you must use `IS NULL`, not `= NULL`). | `WHERE manager_id IS NULL` |

```sql
-- Example: Using special operators
SELECT order_id
FROM Orders
WHERE order_date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-01-31'
   OR status IN ('Pending', 'Processing');
```
