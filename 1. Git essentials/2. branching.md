## Branching and Merging

Branches allow you to work on new features or revisions without affecting the main working code (`main` branch).

### Branch Workflow

1.  **Create a new branch:**
    ```bash
    git branch feature/new-notes-section
    ```
2.  **Switch to the new branch:**
    ```bash
    git switch feature/new-notes-section
    ```
    (You can combine these with `git checkout -b <branch-name>` in older Git.)
3.  **Work and Commit:** Make your changes and commit them locally on the new branch.
4.  **Merge the changes:** When ready, switch back to `main` and merge your changes:
    ```bash
    git switch main
    git merge feature/new-notes-section
    ```
5.  **Delete the merged branch:**
    ```bash
    git branch -d feature/new-notes-section
    ```

### Merge Conflicts

A **merge conflict** occurs when Git cannot automatically reconcile different changes made to the *same line* of the *same file* in two separate branches.

  * **Resolution Steps:**
    1.  Git will flag the conflicting file.
    2.  Open the file in VS Code (it provides tools to accept incoming or current changes).
    3.  Manually edit the file to the correct desired state.
    4.  **`git add <conflicting-file>`** (mark as resolved).
    5.  **`git commit -m "fix: Resolve merge conflict for X"`** (complete the merge).

## 🤝 Collaborating (Working with the Remote)

Collaboration involves connecting your local repository to the **remote** repository hosted on GitHub.

| Concept | Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Setup Remote** | `git remote add origin [URL]` | Links your local repo to the remote one (usually done once). |
| **Download Changes** | `git pull origin main` | **Fetches** changes from the remote and immediately **merges** them into your local branch. |
| **Upload Changes** | `git push origin main` | Uploads your local commits to the remote repository. |

4.  `git commit -m "message"`
5.  `git log`
6.  `git diff`
7.  `git checkout [branch]` (or `git switch`)
8.  `git branch [name]`
9.  `git merge [branch]`
10. `git restore [file]`
11. `git pull origin main`
12. `git push origin main`
